# BonziWORLD

This project has been discontinued due to my time being taken up by other responsibilities. Thanks for all the laughs and memes along the way.

**This project was unarchived in order to document security issues. However, barely anyone used issues for that purpose are more often created irrelevant complaints. To be clear, *I no longer have anything to do with any actively hosted instance of BonziWORLD or any of the community.* Do not bug me about anything related to BonziWORLD, I have nothing to do with it and no longer want anything to do with it.**

All the source code for the server and client is publically available here. If you want to run your own BonziWORLD, by all means go ahead. Do whatever you'd like with this code. Just try to put me somewhere in the credits.

## Dependencies
- Node.js and npm
- Ruby
- Sass
- Git
- Cordova (Optional)

## Setup
In a terminal/command prompt, navigate to where you'd like BonziWORLD to be placed and run the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/joseph14078/BonziWORLD
cd BonziWORLD
```

### Client
```
cd src
npm install
grunt build_www
cd ..
```

### Server
```
cd server
npm install
node index.js
```
After this, BonziWORLD will be accessible on port 3000. (http://localhost:3000/)

## Disclaimer
I'm not responsible if you screw up anything with your computer while setting this up. I have no idea how you would, but someone will find a way. I also will not provide support for installing dependencies. If you have everything installed properly, the above commands will work.
